# HomeOps

Home Infra Repo backed by Flux

This repo was rebased on the cluster template at commit [5361aaa](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template/commit/5361aaac36e4226ebae9689436331a8b793ad875).


## Useful Tools

- [pv-migrate](https://github.com/utkuozdemir/pv-migrate)
- [K9S](https://k9scli.io/)
- [krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/)


## ✨ Features

2. **"Flux cluster with Cloudflare"** - An addition to "**Flux cluster**" that provides DNS and SSL with [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) is also included to provide external access to certain applications deployed in your cluster.

    - **Required:** A Cloudflare account with a domain managed in your Cloudflare account.
    - **Components:** [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/), [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) and [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared).

2. Flash the iso or raw file to a USB drive and boot to Talos on your nodes with it.

### 🔧 Stage 3: Bootstrap configuration

2. Fill out the `config.yaml` configuration file using the comments in that file as a guide.

3. Run the following command which will generate all the files needed to continue.

    ```sh
    task configure
    ```

4. Push you changes to git

   📍 _**Verify** all the `./kubernetes/**/*.sops.*` files are **encrypted** with SOPS_

    ```sh
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Initial commit :rocket:"
    git push
    ```

### ⛵ Stage 4: Install Kubernetes

1. Deploy your cluster and bootstrap it. This generates secrets, generates the config files for your nodes and applies them. It bootstraps the cluster afterwards, fetches the kubeconfig file and installs Cilium and kubelet-csr-approver. It finishes with some health checks.

    ```sh
    task talos:bootstrap
    ```

2. ⚠️ It might take a while for the cluster to be setup (10+ minutes is normal), during which time you will see a variety of error messages like: "couldn't get current server API group list," "error: no matching resources found", etc. This is a normal. If this step gets interrupted, e.g. by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, you likely will need to [nuke the cluster](#-Nuke) before trying again.

#### Cluster validation

1. The `kubeconfig` for interacting with your cluster should have been created in the root of your repository.

2. Verify the nodes are online

    📍 _If this command **fails** you likely haven't configured `direnv` as [mentioned previously](#non-devcontainer-method) in the guide._

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    # NAME           STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
    # k8s-0          Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   1h      v1.30.1
    # k8s-1          Ready    worker                      1h      v1.30.1
    ```

3. Continue on to 🔹 [**Stage 6**](#-stage-6-install-flux-in-your-cluster)

### 🔹 Stage 6: Install Flux in your cluster

1. Verify Flux can be installed

    ```sh
    flux check --pre
    # ► checking prerequisites
    # ✔ kubectl 1.30.1 >=1.18.0-0
    # ✔ Kubernetes 1.30.1 >=1.16.0-0
    # ✔ prerequisites checks passed
    ```

2. Install Flux and sync the cluster to the Git repository

    📍 _Run `task flux:github-deploy-key` first if using a private repository._

    ```sh
    task flux:bootstrap
    # namespace/flux-system configured
    # customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alerts.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io created
    # ...
    ```

1. Verify Flux components are running in the cluster

    ```sh
    kubectl -n flux-system get pods -o wide
    # NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    # helm-controller-5bbd94c75-89sb4            1/1     Running   0          1h
    # kustomize-controller-7b67b6b77d-nqc67      1/1     Running   0          1h
    # notification-controller-7c46575844-k4bvr   1/1     Running   0          1h
    # source-controller-7d6875bcb4-zqw9f         1/1     Running   0          1h
    ```

### 🎤 Verification Steps

_Mic check, 1, 2_ - In a few moments applications should be lighting up like Christmas in July 🎄

1. Output all the common resources in your cluster.

    📍 _Feel free to use the provided [kubernetes tasks](.taskfiles/Kubernetes/Taskfile.yaml) for validation of cluster resources or continue to get familiar with the `kubectl` and `flux` CLI tools._

    ```sh
    task kubernetes:resources
    ```

2. ⚠️ It might take `cert-manager` awhile to generate certificates, this is normal so be patient.

3. 🏆 **Congratulations** if all goes smooth you will have a Kubernetes cluster managed by Flux and your Git repository is driving the state of your cluster.

4. 🧠 Now it's time to pause and go get some motel motor oil ☕ and admire you made it this far!

## 📣 Flux w/ Cloudflare post installation

#### 🌐 Public DNS

The `external-dns` application created in the `networking` namespace will handle creating public DNS records. By default, `echo-server` and the `flux-webhook` are the only subdomains reachable from the public internet. In order to make additional applications public you must set set the correct ingress class name and ingress annotations like in the HelmRelease for `echo-server`.

#### 🏠 Home DNS

`k8s_gateway` will provide DNS resolution to external Kubernetes resources (i.e. points of entry to the cluster) from any device that uses your home DNS server. For this to work, your home DNS server must be configured to forward DNS queries for `${bootstrap_cloudflare.domain}` to `${bootstrap_cloudflare.gateway_vip}` instead of the upstream DNS server(s) it normally uses. This is a form of **split DNS** (aka split-horizon DNS / conditional forwarding).

> [!TIP]
> Below is how to configure a Pi-hole for split DNS. Other platforms should be similar.
> 1. Apply this file on the Pihole server while substituting the variables
> ```sh
> # /etc/dnsmasq.d/99-k8s-gateway-forward.conf
> server=/${bootstrap_cloudflare.domain}/${bootstrap_cloudflare.gateway_vip}
> ```
> 2. Restart dnsmasq on the server.
> 3. Query an internal-only subdomain from your workstation (any `internal` class ingresses): `dig @${home-dns-server-ip} echo-server-internal.${bootstrap_cloudflare.domain}`. It should resolve to `${bootstrap_cloudflare.ingress_vip}`.

If you're having trouble with DNS be sure to check out these two GitHub discussions: [Internal DNS](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template/discussions/719) and [Pod DNS resolution broken](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template/discussions/635).

... Nothing working? That is expected, this is DNS after all!

#### 📜 Certificates

By default this template will deploy a wildcard certificate using the Let's Encrypt **staging environment**, which prevents you from getting rate-limited by the Let's Encrypt production servers if your cluster doesn't deploy properly (for example due to a misconfiguration). Once you are sure you will keep the cluster up for more than a few hours be sure to switch to the production servers as outlined in `config.yaml`.

📍 _You will need a production certificate to reach internet-exposed applications through `cloudflared`._

#### 🪝 Github Webhook

By default Flux will periodically check your git repository for changes. In order to have Flux reconcile on `git push` you must configure Github to send `push` events to Flux.

> [!NOTE]
> This will only work after you have switched over certificates to the Let's Encrypt Production servers.

1. Obtain the webhook path

    📍 _Hook id and path should look like `/hook/12ebd1e363c641dc3c2e430ecf3cee2b3c7a5ac9e1234506f6f5f3ce1230e123`_

    ```sh
    kubectl -n flux-system get receiver github-receiver -o jsonpath='{.status.webhookPath}'
    ```

2. Piece together the full URL with the webhook path appended

    ```text
    https://flux-webhook.${bootstrap_cloudflare.domain}/hook/12ebd1e363c641dc3c2e430ecf3cee2b3c7a5ac9e1234506f6f5f3ce1230e123
    ```

3. Navigate to the settings of your repository on Github, under "Settings/Webhooks" press the "Add webhook" button. Fill in the webhook URL and your `bootstrap_github_webhook_token` secret in `config.yaml`, Content type: `application/json`, Events: Choose Just the push event, and save.

## 💥 Nuke

There might be a situation where you want to destroy your Kubernetes cluster. The following command will reset your nodes back to maintenance mode, append `--force` to completely format your the Talos installation. Either way the nodes should reboot after the command has run.

```sh
task talos:nuke
```

## 🤖 Renovate

[Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate) is a tool that automates dependency management. It is designed to scan your repository around the clock and open PRs for out-of-date dependencies it finds. Common dependencies it can discover are Helm charts, container images, GitHub Actions, Ansible roles... even Flux itself! Merging a PR will cause Flux to apply the update to your cluster.

To enable Renovate, click the 'Configure' button over at their [Github app page](https://github.com/apps/renovate) and select your repository. Renovate creates a "Dependency Dashboard" as an issue in your repository, giving an overview of the status of all updates. The dashboard has interactive checkboxes that let you do things like advance scheduling or reattempt update PRs you closed without merging.

The base Renovate configuration in your repository can be viewed at [.github/renovate.json5](./.github/renovate.json5). By default it is scheduled to be active with PRs every weekend, but you can [change the schedule to anything you want](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-schedule), or remove it if you want Renovate to open PRs right away.

## 🐛 Debugging

Below is a general guide on trying to debug an issue with an resource or application. For example, if a workload/resource is not showing up or a pod has started but in a `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Pending` state.

1. Start by checking all Flux Kustomizations & Git Repository & OCI Repository and verify they are healthy.

    ```sh
    flux get sources oci -A
    flux get sources git -A
    flux get ks -A
    ```

2. Then check all the Flux Helm Releases and verify they are healthy.

    ```sh
    flux get hr -A
    ```

3. Then check the if the pod is present.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o wide
    ```

4. Then check the logs of the pod if its there.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> logs <pod-name> -f
    # or
    stern -n <namespace> <fuzzy-name>
    ```

5. If a resource exists try to describe it to see what problems it might have.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> describe <resource> <name>
    ```

6. Check the namespace events

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
    ```

Resolving problems that you have could take some tweaking of your YAML manifests in order to get things working, other times it could be a external factor like permissions on NFS. If you are unable to figure out your problem see the help section below.

## ⬆️ Upgrading Talos and Kubernetes

### Manual

```sh
# Upgrade Talos to a newer version
# NOTE: This needs to be run once on every node
task talos:upgrade node=? image=?
# e.g.
# task talos:upgrade node=192.168.42.10 image=factory.talos.dev/installer/${schematic_id}:v1.7.4
```

```sh
# Upgrade Kubernetes to a newer version
# NOTE: This only needs to be run once against a controller node
task talos:upgrade-k8s controller=? to=?
# e.g.
# task talos:upgrade-k8s controller=192.168.42.10 to=1.30.1
```

## ❔ What's next

The cluster is your oyster (or something like that). Below are some optional considerations you might want to review.

### Ship it

To browse or get ideas on applications people are running, community member [@whazor](https://github.com/whazor) created [Kubesearch](https://kubesearch.dev) as a creative way to search Flux HelmReleases across Github and Gitlab.

### Storage

The included CSI (openebs in local-hostpath mode) is a great start for storage but soon you might find you need more features like replicated block storage, or to connect to a NFS/SMB/iSCSI server. If you need any of those features be sure to check out the projects like [rook-ceph](https://github.com/rook/rook), [longhorn](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn), [openebs](https://github.com/openebs/openebs), [democratic-csi](https://github.com/democratic-csi/democratic-csi), [csi-driver-nfs](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs),
and [synology-csi](https://github.com/SynologyOpenSource/synology-csi).
